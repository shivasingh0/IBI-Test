1. Sharding in MongoDB is a data distribution strategy that enables horizontal scaling and handling large datasets by distributing data across multiple servers or shards.
2. Sharding uses a shard key to determine how data is distributed across shards.
3. Each shard contains a portion of the dataset, and the mongos routers direct queries to the appropriate shard based on the shard key.
4. Sharding provides horizontal scalability, improved performance, and isolation of data.
5. Choosing an appropriate shard key is critical for efficient data distribution and minimizing data migrations.
